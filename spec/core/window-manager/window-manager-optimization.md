üß† DineApp OS ‚Äì Window Manager Optimization & Best Practices
1. Architectural Goals

The Window Manager is the OS core engine, not a UI component.
Its job is to maintain deterministic, low-latency window state updates with minimal reactivity overhead.

Primary Goals

Zero re-render overhead per frame (no full store diffing)

Predictable event emission via eventBus

Isolation per plugin and per window

Memory safety and deterministic cleanup

Native-feeling performance (< 16 ms per operation)

2. Core Architectural Principles
   Principle	Description	Implementation Hint
   Stateless UI Layer	Window UI shells (titlebar, resize handles) must remain dumb.	UI reads from window state and emits actions only via EventBus.
   Solid Granularity	Use fine-grained reactivity: one store per window, not one global store for all.	Convert createStore<Window[]> ‚Üí Map<string, WindowStore> pattern.
   Immutable Operations	Always replace shallow objects to avoid reactive cascade.	Use shallow cloning ({ ...window, ...updates }) per update.
   Z-Index Safety	Keep nextZIndex inside an atomic signal.	Avoid global mutations when multiple plugins open concurrently.
   Lifecycle Determinism	Window open/close must always emit paired window:opened and window:closed events.	Wrap with try/finally semantics in emit paths.
3. Web API Optimization Layer
   ‚úÖ Use Browser-Native APIs
   Feature	API	Why
   Resize detection	ResizeObserver	Tracks layout changes more efficiently than polling.
   Viewport bounds	VisualViewport	More accurate on mobile/tablets vs window.innerWidth.
   Z-Index batching	requestIdleCallback	Defer non-critical stacking recalculations.
   Animations	Element.animate()	Avoid setTimeout for CSS transitions; tie to Promise.
   ‚öôÔ∏è Example Strategy

Attach one shared ResizeObserver that dispatches window:resized events via eventBus.

Batch updates with requestAnimationFrame (one write phase per tick).

Avoid measuring layout on each drag ‚Äî throttle to ~60 fps using requestAnimationFrame.

4. Reactivity & Store Design
   üîπ Recommended Pattern
   const windowStores = new Map<string, ReturnType<typeof createStore<Window>>>();

function createWindowStore(initial: Window) {
const [state, set] = createStore(initial);
return { state, set };
}


Then expose high-level actions (open, minimize, restore) that operate on individual stores.
This minimizes Solid‚Äôs reconciliation overhead.

üîπ Benefits

No global diff for all windows.

Fast granular updates.

Easy disposal per window (windowStores.delete(id) on close).

5. Performance Strategies
   Area	Strategy	Target
   Render cost	Avoid unnecessary Solid context providers inside window shells.	< 1 ms re-render
   Reflows	Batch style/position writes via requestAnimationFrame.	60 fps drag
   Memory	Clear event listeners on unload via eventBus.offAll(windowScope).	0 retained nodes
   Animation timing	Use CSS transitions tied to animationend events, not arbitrary timeouts.	Deterministic UI feedback
   z-Index management	Keep O(1) z-ordering. Avoid sorting array each time.	Constant time reordering
   Diagnostics	Implement windowManager.inspect() for debugging states.	Developer visibility
6. EventBus Integration
   ‚úÖ DO

Use eventBus.emitSync() for UI updates (focus, minimize).

Use eventBus.emit() for async transitions (animations, analytics).

Scope events by window ID (window:${id}:focused) when needed for granular updates.

Unregister all listeners on window:closed.

‚ùå DON‚ÄôT

Don‚Äôt re-emit internal events (avoid A ‚Üí B ‚Üí A feedback loops).

Don‚Äôt mutate event payloads ‚Äî always clone before emitting.

Don‚Äôt perform heavy logic inside event handlers (offload to service).

7. Memory and Lifecycle Safety

Each window lifecycle should always follow this deterministic pattern:

create() ‚Üí render() ‚Üí minimize/maximize/restore() ‚Üí close()


Rules:

Never leave partial states (minimizing, ghost) unreset.

Each openWindow must call eventBus.emitSync('window:opened') before render.

Each closeWindow must call offAll(windowScope) and then eventBus.emitSync('window:closed').

Never keep component references after closed (let GC reclaim memory).

8. Browser Feature Recommendations
   Goal	API	Notes
   Accurate positioning	getBoundingClientRect() inside ResizeObserver	Syncs resize/drag events with layout.
   Energy-efficient animations	CSS transform: translate3d()	GPU-accelerated dragging/resizing.
   Snap feedback	IntersectionObserver	Detect snap zones near viewport edges.
   Focus tracking	PointerLock or focusin/out	For modal-like behavior.
9. Developer DOs and DON‚ÄôTs
   ‚úÖ DO

Keep logic in WindowManager, UI just visual.

Use composables like useWindowDrag() and useWindowResize() for consistency.

Reuse shared styles and transitions from @ui/window.

Emit standardized events (window:focused, not winFocus).

‚ùå DON‚ÄôT

Don‚Äôt measure layout on every drag pixel (use throttle).

Don‚Äôt mutate global arrays directly.

Don‚Äôt use timeouts for animation completion ‚Äî use event listeners.

Don‚Äôt store DOM nodes inside stores.

10. Diagnostics & Observability

Provide internal diagnostics for developer tools:

windowManager.inspect() -> {
totalWindows,
focusedWindow,
zIndexRange,
memoryUsage,
activeListeners,
}


Add __diagnostics:window events to eventBus for live telemetry in dev mode.

11. Example Performance Targets
    Metric	Target	Notes
    Open/Close latency	< 30 ms	Instant user feedback
    Resize latency	< 10 ms	Smooth drag
    Concurrent windows	‚â• 25	Without frame drops
    Memory per window	‚â§ 150 KB	Includes store + UI
    Event dispatch latency	< 1 ms	Measured via eventBus diagnostics
12. Summary
    Aspect	Objective	Mechanism
    Performance	Maintain 60 FPS even under stress	rAF, ResizeObserver, granular stores
    Maintainability	Modular stores per window, scoped events	Map<string, WindowStore>
    Stability	Deterministic lifecycle & cleanup	offAll(scope)
    Extensibility	Plugin-driven window creation	windowManager.openWindow()
    Diagnostics	Built-in inspect/debug hooks	windowManager.inspect()
